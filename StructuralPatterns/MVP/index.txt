MVP Design Pattern

MODEL VIEW PRESENTER

Which Is Loosely Based on MVC

Here View Not Have Access to MODEL

ONLY VIEW Can Access The PRESENTER And PRESENTER Access the Model

So it's more Abstract layer than MVC And this the Difference between them 

So The VIEW Here has to get all Data From Presenter and Presenter Serves The Logic

This Pattern So Popular with Andriod Developers
